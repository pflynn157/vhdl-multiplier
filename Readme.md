## VHDL Multiplier

This is a simple VHDL multiplier for 8-bit numbers.

This is my first attempt at making something like this. Multipliers are slow anyway, but this one is extremely slow, taking 25 clock cycles (250 ns) to compute the product. I eventually want to expand it and reduce the number of clock cycles by working on multiple bits in parallel.
